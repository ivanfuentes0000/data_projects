## This project analyzes Superstore's customer returns to understand contributing factors and develop strategies for reduction.

### Visualized return rates across multiple dimensions, revealing a potential correlation between high return rates and specific product sub-categories like "Binders" and "Machines."

### I built a Tableau dashboard displaying return rates by geographic location (map), sales vs. returns (scatterplot), time (line chart), and product category (bar chart). The goal was to provide a comprehensive view of return patterns to inform decision-making.

### The project addressed the need to understand the drivers behind Superstore's customer returns, enabling targeted interventions to minimize losses and improve customer satisfaction.

### Tableau was used to create the interactive dashboard.

### This was a solo project with me building a dashboard for monitoring returns and presenting a demo analysis and dashboard.

### Conclusions:

### There appears to be a positive correlation between sales and returns in some subcategories (scatterplot). "Binders" and "Machines" exhibit high return rates (bar chart). Return rates fluctuate over time, potentially indicating seasonal influences (line chart). Geographic concentrations of returns are noticeable (map).

### Recommendations:

### Investigate the reasons for high returns in "Binders" and "Machines." This could involve product quality issues, inaccurate descriptions, or shipping problems. Analyze the geographic data to identify specific regions with high return rates and tailor strategies accordingly. Explore the seasonal patterns in returns to optimize inventory and customer service during peak periods. Further investigate the outliers in the sales vs. returns scatterplot to understand unique cases.
