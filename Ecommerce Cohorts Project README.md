## This project analyzed user activity logs to optimize the e-commerce conversion funnel and improve customer retention.

### Identified key drop-off points in the conversion funnel, revealing a 64.39% drop-off between adding items to the cart and completing a purchase. (Calculated as 100% \- 35.61% purchase conversion rate from cart additions).

### I built a business analytics report analyzing user activity on an e-commerce website. The goal was to understand user behavior, identify areas for improvement in the conversion funnel, and assess customer retention.

### The project addressed the need to understand user engagement and identify bottlenecks in the customer journey from viewing a product to making a purchase. It also aimed to evaluate customer retention over time.

### Google Sheets was used to analyze the raw transaction logs.

### Conclusion: The analysis revealed a 29% conversion rate from viewing a product to adding it to the cart, and a 36% conversion rate from adding to cart to purchase. Retention rates decreased over time across all cohorts, indicating a need for strategies to improve customer loyalty.

### Recommendations: Investigate the significant drop-off between adding to cart and purchase. Implement strategies to improve customer retention, such as targeted marketing campaigns or loyalty programs. Further analysis could explore correlations between product categories, brands, and user behavior. \[HERE\] ([Ecommerce Cohorts Project](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17dhXEQQ9uBjHUEcEDBHvy_lmJL7LaqYQtPsbDIazdRY/edit?usp=sharing))
