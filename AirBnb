## Analyzed Manhattan Airbnb data to identify optimal vacation rental investment opportunities. This project addressed the client's need to understand which neighborhoods and property sizes are most attractive to renters and how much revenue these properties generate. 

Cleaned and analyzed large Airbnb datasets in Google Sheets, identifying top-performing neighborhoods and property types to inform investment recommendations in the Manhattan vacation rental market.

Using Google sheet data cleaning and analysis, and leveraging pivot tables in Excel, the analysis revealed that 1-bedroom apartments are highly sought after, particularly in East Harlem, Flatiron District, and Chinatown.

One top-performing listing (ID 49946551) demonstrated a potential annual revenue of $60,000 based on a 30-day sample. 

Recommendations include focusing on 1-bedroom properties in Harlem, exploring 2-bedroom investments in East Harlem and Flatiron, and considering studio listings in Chinatown. 

In conclusion, the Manhattan vacation rental market presents lucrative opportunities, especially for smaller property types in the identified neighborhoods.  By strategically aligning property offerings and pricing with market demand, investors can maximize their returns. 

This data-driven approach allows for targeted investment strategies to maximize returns in the competitive Manhattan vacation rental market. (This project was completed individually for 2 weeks.)
